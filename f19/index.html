      <p>
        If you want to enroll in this 2-credit project based course,
        (a) join the waitlist online, making sure you enroll in the section
        taught by Tyler Caraza-Harter, and (b) and
        fill <a href="https://forms.gle/Jnt2GMNaDF4UAU3z9">this form</a>.
        I'll let you know if you can take the course by Aug 28th.  We might
        not have room for everybody interested, unfortunately.  The prereq is
        CS 301.  If you haven't taken that, but have experience with Python
        (including Jupyter, pandas, and matplotlib), I may override the
        prereq; in this case, please email me (tylerharter@gmail.com) a
        Jupyter notebook file demoing your skills.  You'll need a laptop that
        you'll use to present your work to the class on a regular basis (you
        might need to buy a video adapter for the room if you don't have an
        HDMI port).
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Time</b>: 4-6pm on Thursdays.
      </p>

      <p>
        This course will involve writing Python code to analyze and
        visualize data sets about the City of Madison, WI.  The goal
        will be to arrive at actionable suggestions.  In 2012, the
        city adopted an open-data policy; projects will analyze data
        that is released under this policy
        (http://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/) and possibly
        other data that city collaborators may provide for this
        course.  Project teams will create data visualizations and
        present them to the class on a weekly basis.  Teams will
        choose their projects and set their own research agenda.
        Possible topics include, but are not limited to, (1) exploring
        alterations to metro routes to improve efficiency, (2)
        identifying ways to reduce traffic accidents, (3) projecting
        property tax revenue, (4) simulating changes in salary
        spending across city departments, and (5) identifying ways to
        reduce incident response times for the fire and police
        departments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students will form teams of 2-4 people and choose a topic.  Within each team, each of you will be expected to produce 2-3 high-quality visualizations per week about your chosen topic; the code and plots will be committed to a team git repo. You will state the question(s) that motivate each plot and explicitly write their conclusions; you will further organize the plots into a logical narrative sequence.  Each week, you should be prepared to present your weekly analysis to the class; depending on enrollment, you might present every week, or I may randomly select a subset of the class to present each week.  At the end of the semester, each team will consolidate their results into a full presentation.  You will be graded on (1) your visualizations, (2) your communication about those visualizations, (3) your participation in discussing the results of other students, and (4) your final presentation.
