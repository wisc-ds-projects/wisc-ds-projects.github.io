        "Potential reasons of intersection crashes are obtained by pulling from variable \"*DRVRPC*\" in the original dataset. However, for each intersection crash, it may have multiple reasons which means that we cannot directly group by this variable and count the number. In order to address this problem, a loop was conducted to go through each data and the reasons are counted by a dictionary.\n",

        "City street and highway name is given in the dataset but the detailed intersection data is not provided. So, intersection crash data cannot be pulled directly from the dataset. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, we can group by street names to extract intersection of two streets but due to lots of missing street names and the intersection condition in reality, the result of this method is not ideal and even aweful. For example, the most dangerous highway intersection given by this method is E Washington Ave & Aberg Ave. But by looking at satellite plot on google map, this is not an intersection but an elevated road (just as shown in the following).\n",

        "So we tried to add clustering model trained by latitude and longtitude data because location data have no missing value. The clustering model used is DBSCAN. It is a density based clustering algorithm that works well on spatial data. The most important parameter in this model is \"*eps*\" defined as the maximum distance between two samples. The average highway and city street intersection length is about 35m and 23m (https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/lane-width/). So, after setting \"*eps*\" correctly, the model can give us a precise intersection cluster result. The detailed info about this model can be found here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html\n",

        "The dataset \"Madison_crash_2009_2019.csv\" from https://topslab.wisc.edu/\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "My investigation focuses on accidents of second common transportation tools, such as bikes, trucks, buses, and cycles. Although the number of accidents for these transportation tools is relatively small, it deserves our attention for several reasons. Bicycle involved accidents are often accompanied by serious injuries, and truck-related accidents are more likely to cause severe traffic jams.\n",
        "### Technical Details\n",
        "The dataset provides the types of cars involved in the accidents in two separate columns and with a variety of types of cars. For instance, it classifies truck into TRK DB(double bottom), TRK NA(not attached), TRK SA(semi attached), TRK ST(insert truck). To have a more general view of the accidents, I integrate subgroups of types of vehicles into their main groups (classify TRK DB, TRK NA,etc. into TRK). Then I add a new column to the dataframe to describe both types of vehicles involved in the accidents (carTotruck, carTocar, etc.), and the x-axis of my plot is based on the new column.\n",

        "### Methdology\n",
        "To find if there is any pattern in the dark time carTotruck accidents, given such a great number compare with others, I plotted all the dark time carTotruck accidents. Surprisingly, most of which happened in Interstate 39/90, as the three red box indicates. Since the light condition for those accidents are dark, I assumed that either there are no street lights or the street lights are broken. I found the madison street lights distribution from Madison open data, and downloaded its shapefile to add into my dark time carTotruck accidents map. By observing the non-overlapped area, I noticed that for all three areas there are no street lights nearby.\n",
